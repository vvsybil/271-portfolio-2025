For Lab 4, we needed to design and prototype a virtual tour webpage in Figma, with the following elements:

*1. Webpage Structure*
Home Page – The starting page for your virtual tour.
Menu – A navigation system that lets users access every page.
Three Landmark Pages – Each showcasing a specific location with:
* A name
* A set of images
* A text description
* Interactive image containers (with different interactions for each page)

*2. Interactive Features*
* Each landmark page should have a unique type of interaction.
* At least one page must use Smart Animate to transform an element (e.g., resizing an image).
* Leave a note in the Figma file explaining where and how Smart Animate is used.

*3. Images*
* Use images relevant to your chosen theme (e.g., Genshin Impact locations).
* Creative Commons images are preferred, but copyrighted images are allowed for educational purposes.

Here is what I created:
